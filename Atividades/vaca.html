    <p>Cows reproduce by sexual reproduction, similar to humans. Female cows, called cows, can become pregnant at around 2 years of age and will have their first calf at around 3 years of age. Cows have a gestation period of around nine months, after which they give birth to a single calf. Cows can have one calf per year and may have up to 10 calves in their lifetime.</p>
